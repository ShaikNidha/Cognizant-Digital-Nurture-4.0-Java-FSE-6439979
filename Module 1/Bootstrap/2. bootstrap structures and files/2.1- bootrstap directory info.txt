So, you’ve just downloaded Bootstrap from the official website and unzipped the folder—great start! Inside, you’ll mainly see two important folders: css and js. If you’ve also downloaded Bootstrap Icons separately, you’ll find an icons folder too. Let’s break down what each of these folders is all about and what they’re used for.

First up is the css folder. This is where all the style magic happens. You'll find files like bootstrap.css, which is the complete stylesheet in a readable format (great for learning and debugging), and bootstrap.min.css, which is a minified version of the same file—perfect for when you want your website to load faster because it’s smaller in size. There's also bootstrap.rtl.css which is designed for languages that are read from right to left (like Arabic or Hebrew). In addition to the main Bootstrap styles, this folder includes special stylesheets like bootstrap-grid.css for just the grid system and bootstrap-utilities.css for utility classes only, in case you don’t want to use the full framework.

Next is the js folder. This contains the JavaScript files that make interactive Bootstrap components (like modals, dropdowns, carousels, etc.) work. The most commonly used file here is bootstrap.bundle.min.js, which includes all the Bootstrap components plus Popper.js (a helper tool needed for things like dropdowns and tooltips to position correctly). If you’re building something lightweight and don’t need all components, there are unbundled versions too, like bootstrap.min.js, but for most cases, the bundled version is what you’ll want to use.

Finally, if you downloaded Bootstrap Icons separately, you'll see an icons folder. This isn’t included by default in the main Bootstrap download, but it’s super useful if you want to add icons to your buttons, navbars, and other components. Inside, you’ll find a CSS file called bootstrap-icons.css and a set of SVG or font files that actually render the icons on your page. After linking the icon CSS, you can use icons just by adding simple classes like <i class="bi bi-heart"></i> in your HTML.

In short, the css folder gives your site its visual style, the js folder makes it interactive, and the optional icons folder adds that extra visual touch with symbols and icons. With just these folders and files, you have everything you need to start building clean, responsive, and modern websites using Bootstrap—all without touching the internet again.
